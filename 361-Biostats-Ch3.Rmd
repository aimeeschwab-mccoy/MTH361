## Application: Lung volume

The forced expiratory volume (FEV, measured in liters) is a primary indicator of successful lung function and corresponds to the volume of air that can be forcibly be blown out in the first second after fully breathing in. A study of FEV on a sample of $n=654$ children measured the children's age, FEV, height, sex, and whether they had been exposed to second-hand smoke.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

head(FEV)
```

---

## Application: Lung volume

Describe the histogram of __forced expiratory volume__.

.pull-left[
```{r plot-last1, fig.show = 'hide', echo=TRUE}
FEV %>% ggplot(aes(x=fev)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=15, 
                 fill='blue', 
                 col='black') + 
  labs(title=
         'Distribution of FEV')
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = 'plot-last1', echo = FALSE}
```
]

## Application: Lung volume

.pull-left[
```{r plot-last2, fig.show = 'hide', echo=TRUE}
FEV %>% ggplot(aes(x=height)) +

                 fill='blue',

         'Distribution of 
          height')

## Normal model

It turns out that this “bell-shaped curve” is a common shape in nature. So common, that the probability distribution that generates this curve is called the __normal model__.

.bg-washed-yellow.b--yellow.ba.ph3[
__Normal model__: a continuous probability distribution (any value in an interval is possible) that always describes a symmetric, bell-shaped curve with two parameters: mean and standard deviation
]

- We denote the mean as $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$.

--

The normal model, which is also sometimes called the __normal distribution__, is a great approximation to many natural variables. 

---

## Properties of the normal model

1.	Continuous distribution, so probability is measured by the area under the curve
2.	Symmetric and unimodal about the mean $\mu$
3.	Probability distribution is highest at exactly $\mu$

```{r}
x <- seq(from=-3, to=3, length=200)
data <- tibble(x=x, dx=dnorm(x))

data %>% ggplot(aes(x=x, y=dx)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x='x', y='Density')
```

---

## Finding normal probabilities

To find the probability of observing a __range__ of outcomes, we need to find the area under the curve.

```{r}
x <- seq(from=-3, to=3, length=200)
data <- tibble(x=x, dx=dnorm(x))

data %>% ggplot(aes(x=x, y=dx)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x='x', y='Density') + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                xlim = c(-2,0),
                geom = "area", fill='blue', alpha=0.5) 
```

---

## Finding normal probabilities

- This may be easier said than done. The probability distribution for the normal distribution is:

$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}e^{-(x-\mu)^{2}/2\sigma^{2}}$$

--

- How do we find the area under a curve? 

---

## Calculating normal probabilities

In base `R`, the function `pnorm` calculates probabilities and `qnorm` calculates quantiles (percentiles) using a normal model.

--

- I prefer `xpnorm` and `xqnorm` from the `mosaic` library. Here's why.

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--blue.ba.ph3[
__Example__: Let's apply the normal model to the lung volume of children in the FEV study. 
]

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(mosaic)
favstats(~fev, data=FEV)
```

---

## `pnorm` v. `xpnorm`

Assume forced expiratory volume (FEV) follows a normal model with $\mu=2.64$ and $\sigma=0.87$. Find the probability that a child has FEV less than 1.5.

```{r pnorm, eval=FALSE}
pnorm(1.5, mean=2.64, sd=0.87) 
```

```{r}
library(flair)
decorate('pnorm') %>% flair('1.5')
```

---

## `pnorm` v. `xpnorm`

Assume forced expiratory volume (FEV) follows a normal model with $\mu=2.64$ and $\sigma=0.87$. Find the probability that a child has FEV less than 1.5.

```{r}
decorate('pnorm') %>% flair_args()
```

---

Compare the output you get with `pnorm` to the output using `xpnorm`.

```{r xpnorm, eval=FALSE}
xpnorm(1.5, mean=2.64, sd=0.87)
```

```{r}
decorate('xpnorm') %>% flair('x')
```

---

## Finding quantiles

.bg-washed-blue.b--blue.ba.ph3[
__Example__: Assume FEV follows a normal model with $\mu=2.64$ and $\sigma=0.87$. Find the lung capacity of the lowest 40% of children.
]

```{r qnorm, echo=TRUE}
qnorm(0.40, mean=2.64, sd=0.87)
```

---

```{r xqnorm, eval=FALSE}
xqnorm(0.40, mean=2.64, sd=0.87)
```

```{r}
decorate('xqnorm') %>% flair('x')
```

---

## Application: Birth weights

The babies born in single births in the United States have birth weights that are approximately normally distributed with mean 3.296 kg and standard deviation 0.560 kg.

- What is the probability of a baby being born weighing between 3 kg and 4 kg?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
xpnorm(___, mean=___, sd=___)
```

- What is the probability of a baby being born weighing more than 5 kg?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
xpnorm(___, mean=___, sd=___)
```

---

## z-scores

Comparing values across different normal distributions can be tricky. 

.bg-washed-yellow.b--yellow.ba.ph3[
__z-score__: a standardized normal useful for comparison

$$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$
]

- A negative $z$-score indicates an observation below the mean

- A positive $z$-score indicates a value above the mean

---

## Standard normal

$z$-scores follow a special case of the normal distribution called the __standard normal distribution__:

$Normal(\mu=0, \sigma=1)$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
x <- seq(from=-3, to=3, length=1000)
y <- dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)
data <- as.data.frame(cbind(x, y))

data %>% ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_line() + labs(title='Standard Normal Distribution', x='x', y='Density')
```

---

## Application: Birth weights

The babies born in singleton births in the United States have birth weights that are approximately normally distributed with mean 3.296 kg and standard deviation 0.560 kg.

- What fraction of babies are more than 1.5 standard deviations from the mean in either direction?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
xpnorm(___, mean=___, sd=___)
```


- What fraction of babies are more than 1.5 kg from the mean in either direction?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
xpnorm(___, mean=___, sd=___)
```

---

## Application: Spy heights

It was rumored that Britain's domestic intelligence service MI5 has an upper limit on the height of its spies, on the assumption that tall people stand out. (For the record - they deny this.) The rumor says that, to apply to be a spy, you can be no taller than 5 feet 11 inches (180.3 cm) if you are a man, and no taller than 5 feet 8 inches (172.7 cm) if you are a woman -- supposedly to allow the spies to blend in with a crowd.

Adult heights are known to be approximately normally distributed. For males, $x \sim Normal(177.0, 7.1)$ and for females, $x \sim Normal(163.3, 6.4)$. 

- What proportion of British males are eligible to apply to MI5?
- What proportion of British females are eligible to apply to MI5?

Sketch a graph of both distributions to help you out.

## Empirical Rule

A simple rule of thumb for working with the normal model is the Empirical Rule.

.bg-washed-green.b--green.ba.ph3[

__Empirical Rule__:

1.	Approximately 68% of all probability in a normal model is within $\mu\pm\sigma$

2.	Approximately 95% of all probability in a normal model is within $\mu\pm2\sigma$

3.	Approximately 99.7% of all probability in a normal model is within $\mu\pm3\sigma$
]

---

## Application: Birth weights

The babies born in singleton births in the United States have birth weights that are approximately normally distributed with mean 3.296 kg and standard deviation 0.560 kg.

1. Give a range for the central 68% of all birth weights.
2. Give a range for the central 95% of all birth weights.
3. Give a range for nearly all birth weights.

---

# Empirical Rule

This rule _only works for (approximately) normal data_.

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("not_normal.png")
```

## Does data "fit" a normal model?

.bg-washed-yellow.b--yellow.ba.ph3[
__Q-Q Plot__: a quantile-quantile plot plots the sample values from our data against the corresponding "theoretical quantiles" from a normal distribution using converted z-scores
]

- The closer the Q-Q plot is to a straight line, the better our data "fits" a normal model.
- No Q-Q plot will be exactly perfect. Look for obvious deviations!

---

## What to expect in a Q-Q plot

The data sets below were all generated using a $Normal(0, 1)$ model. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cbPalette <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
norm <- as.numeric(rnorm(n=430, mean=0, sd=1))
size <- c(rep('Small (n=30)', 30), rep('Medium (n=100)', 100), rep('Large (n=300)', 300))

data <- data.frame(cbind(I(norm), size))
data$size <- fct_relevel(data$size, 'Small (n=30)', 'Medium (n=100)')

data %>% ggplot(aes(x=norm, fill=size)) + geom_histogram(bins=15) + facet_wrap(~size, scale='free') + guides(fill=FALSE) 
```

---

## What to expect in a Q-Q plot

Here's the Q-Q plots for these three normal data sets.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(sample=norm, color=size)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + facet_wrap(~size) + guides(col=FALSE)
```

---

## What to expect in a Q-Q plot

What happens when we have clearly non-normal data sets?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
nonnorm1 <- rbeta(n=100, shape1=1, shape2=4)
nonnorm2 <- rbeta(n=100, shape1=5, shape2=1)
nonnorm3 <- rbeta(n=100, shape1=0.25, shape2=0.25)

nonnorm <- as.numeric(c(nonnorm1, nonnorm2, nonnorm3))
type <- c(rep('Skewed right', 100), rep('Skewed left', 100), rep('Bimodal', 100))

data <- data.frame(nonnorm, type)


data %>% ggplot(aes(x=nonnorm, fill=type)) + geom_histogram(bins=15) + facet_wrap(~type) + guides(fill=FALSE)
```

---

## What to expect in a Q-Q plot

Here's the Q-Q plots for these three non-normal data sets.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data %>% ggplot(aes(sample=nonnorm, color=type)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + facet_wrap(~type) + guides(col=FALSE)
```

---

## Application: Lung volume

Would it be reasonable to model FEV using a normal distribution?



---

## Application: height

Would it be reasonable to model height of children using a normal distribution?

.pull-left[
```{r plot-qq2, fig.show = 'hide', echo=TRUE}
FEV %>% ggplot(aes(sample=height)) + 
  stat_qq() + #<<
  stat_qq_line() + #<<
  labs(title=
         'Q-Q plot: Height')
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = 'plot-qq2', echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Application: height

Does gender make a difference?

```{r}
FEV %>% mutate(gender=ifelse(sex==0, 'F', 'M')) %>% ggplot(aes(sample=height)) + 
  stat_qq(aes(col=gender)) + #<<
  stat_qq_line(aes(col=gender)) + #<<
  labs(title=
         'Q-Q plot: Height') +
  facet_wrap(~gender)
```

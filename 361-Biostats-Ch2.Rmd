## Probability

.bg-washed-yellow.b--yellow.ba.ph3[
__Probability__: the probability of an outcome is the proportion of times that outcome would occur if we repeated a random trial many, many times under the exact same conditions
]

---

## Notation

We denote the probability of some event, $E$, as:

$$P(E)$$

To be a valid probability,

$$0\le P(E) \le 1$$

Probabilities beyond this range cannot occur.

- What would $P(E)=0$ imply?
- What would $P(E)=1$ imply?

---

## Considering multiple events

The way we handle probabilities of two or more events depends on their relationship.

.bg-washed-yellow.b--yellow.ba.ph3[

__Mutually exclusive__: two events A and B are called mutually exclusive if they cannot both happen at the same time
]

- Mutually exclusive events are also called __disjoint__.


---

## Considering multiple events

.bg-washed-yellow.b--yellow.ba.ph3[

__Independent__: two events A and B are called independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other, and vice versa
]

- Events that are not independent are called __dependent__.

---

## Probability distributions

.bg-washed-yellow.b--yellow.ba.ph3[
__Probability distribution__: a list of the probabilities of all mutually exclusive outcomes of a random trial
]

Probability distributions may be either _discrete_ or _continuous_, depending on the type of variable we’re considering.

- __Discrete numerical variables__ are measured in countable, indivisible units
- __Continuous numerical variables__ can take on any real number within some range

---

## Addition rule

There are some simple rules we can use to calculate the probabilities associated with multiple events.

.bg-washed-red.b--red.ba.ph3[
__Addition Rule__: if two events are mutually exclusive, then

$$P(A \ and\  B)=P(A)+P(B)$$
]

---

## Addition rule

.bg-washed-blue.b--blue.ba.ph3[
__Example__: Government data assign a single cause for each death that occurs in the US. The data show that, among people aged 15-24, the probability that a randomly chosen death was accidental is 0.41, 0.16 that it was a homicide, and 0.15 that it was a suicide.

What is the probability that a death is due to one of these three causes?
]

---

## Complement rule

.bg-washed-red.b--red.ba.ph3[
__Complement Rule__: the probability that an event does not occur is

$$P(A^c)=1-P(A)$$
]

---

## Complement rule

.bg-washed-blue.b--blue.ba.ph3[
__Example__: Government data assign a single cause for each death that occurs in the US. The data show that, among people aged 15-24, the probability that a randomly chosen death was accidental is 0.41, 0.16 that it was a homicide, and 0.15 that it was a suicide. What is the probability that a death is due to some other cause?
]

---

## General addition rule

.bg-washed-red.b--red.ba.ph3[
__General Addition Rule__: if two events are not mutually exclusive, then

$$P(A \ or\  B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \ and \ B)$$
]

---

## General addition rule

.bg-washed-blue.b--blue.ba.ph3[
__Example__: Insulin injections and oral medication are two key options for treating diabetes. The 2014 National Diabetes Statistics Report provides the breakdown of diabetes treatments among American adults with diagnosed diabetes.

Treatment|Percent
---|---
Insulin only|14.0
Oral medication only|56.9
Both insulin and oral medication|14.7
Neither insulin nor oral medication|14.4

Use the General Addition Rule to find the probability an adult with diabetes uses either insulin or oral medication.
]

---

## Multiplication rule

.bg-washed-red.b--red.ba.ph3[
__Multiplication Rule__: if two events  and  are independent, then

$$P(A \ and\  B)=P(A)\times P(B)$$

]

- The Multiplication Rule is a handy tool for verifying independence!
- The Multiplication Rule extends to three or more events.

## Application: Mandatory drug testing

Mandatory drug testing in the workplace is common practice for certain professions, such as air traffic controllers and transportation workers. A false positive in a drug screening test occurs when the test incorrectly indicates that a screened person is an illegal drug user. 

Suppose a mandatory drug test has a false positive rate of 1.2% (i.e., has probability 0.012 of indicating that an employee is using illegal drugs when that is not the case). Given 150 employees who are in reality drug free, what is the probability that at least one will (falsely) test positive? Assume that the outcome of one drug test has no effect on the others.

---

## Application: Diabetes treatment

Are insulin injections and oral medication independent for treating diabetes? Explain why or why not, both probabilistically and in context.

Treatment|Percent
---|---
Insulin only|14.0
Oral medication only|56.9
Both insulin and oral medication|14.7
Neither insulin nor oral medication|14.4

---

## Application: Genetics

The gene _Prdm9_ is thought to regulate hotspots of recombination (crossing over) in mammals. In the people of Han Chinese descent living in the Los Angeles area there are five alleles at the _Prdm9_ gene: $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_4$, $A_5$. The relative frequencies with which these alleles occur in that population are 0.06, 0.03, 0.84, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively.

Is it reasonable to assume that in this population, the two alleles present in any individual are independently sampled from the population as a whole?

What is the probability that an individual has...

1. Two $A_1$ alleles?
2. One $A_1$ alleles and one $A_3$ allele?
3. No $A_1$ alleles?

---

## Application: Blood types

The probability that a randomly chosen North American has a particular blood type is listed in the table below. 

Type|O+|O-|A+|A-|B+|B-|AB+|AB-
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Prob|0.374|0.066|0.357|0.063|0.085|0.015|0.034|0.006

1. What is the probability that a randomly selected North American has blood type O?
2. B- blood can be safely donated to anyone who has B+, B-, AB+, or AB- blood. What is the probability that a randomly selected North American can receive blood type B-?
3. Only individuals with O+ blood can receive an O+ blood donation. What is the probability that a randomly selected North American cannot receive blood type O+?
4. What is the probability that a randomly selected North American is _Rh_+?
5. What is the probability that a randomly selected North American is _Rh_-?
6. Assume that blood type does not affect the choice of sexual partner. What probability of North American pregnancies will be at risk for _Rh incompatibility_?

## Conditional probability

.bg-washed-yellow.b--yellow.ba.ph3[
__Conditional Probability__: the probability of an event occurring, given that some other event has occurred or condition is met

$$P(A | B)$$

- In English: "the probability of $A$, given $B$.
]

## Application: Diabetes and CKD

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are two diseases that are increasingly burdening the senior population in the United States. A large national sample of visits to the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) system indicates that 8.3% of veterans in their 60s have stage 3-5 CKD. This rate is 14.1% among veterans with diabetes and only 6.4% among veterans without diabetes. Express these percents using probability notation.

---

## Bayes' Theorem

.bg-washed-red.b--red.ba.ph3[
__Bayes’ Theorem__: for any two events A and B the conditional probability can be written as

$$P(A\vert B)=\frac{P(A \ and \ B)}{P(B)}$$
]

---


## Conditional probability

.bg-washed-blue.b--blue.ba.ph3[
__Example__: Find $P(A|B)$. What does it represent?

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

```

]

## Application: Diabetes and CKD

A large national sample of visits to the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) system indicates that 8.3% of veterans in their 60s have stage 3-5 CKD. This rate is 14.1% among veterans with diabetes and only 6.4% among veterans without diabetes. The VHA records also suggest that 25% of veterans in their 60s have diabetes. Find the probability that a randomly selected veteran in their 60s has both diabetes and stage 3-5 CKD.

## Application: Hand washing

According to the American Society of Microbiology (2005), the probability that a man washes his hands after using the restroom at an airport is 0.74 and the probability that a woman washes her hands is 0.83. A waiting room in an airport contains 40 men and 60 women, Assume that all passengers-in-waiting are equally likely to use the restroom. What is the probability that the next individual who goes to the restroom will wash their hands?

---

## Extending Bayes' 

Let $A_1, ..., A_n$ be disjoint events covering the entire sample space. Then, 

$$P(B) = \sum_i P(A_i \ and \ B)$$

Extend Bayes'...

$$P(A_i \vert B)=\frac{P(A_i \ and \ B)}{\sum_i P(A_i \ and \ B)}$$

## Application: Rapid HIV testing

Rapid HIV tests allow for quick diagnosis without expensive laboratory equipment. However, their efficacy has been called into question. In a population of 1517 tested individuals in Uganda, 4 had HIV but tested negative (_false negatives_), 166 had HIV and tested positive, 129 did not have HIV but tested positive (_false positives_) and 1218 did not have HIV and tested negative.

1. What was the probability of a false positive?
2. What was the probability of a false negative?
3. If a randomly sampled individual from this population tests positive on a rapid test, what is the probability that he or she has HIV?

---

## Application: Cystic fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary lung disorder that often results in death. It can be inherited only if both parents are carriers of an abnormal gene. In 1989, the CF gene that is abnormal in carriers of cystic fibrosis was identified. The probability that a randomly chosen person carries an abnormal CF gene is 0.03. The CF20m test detects most, but not all harmful mutations of the CF gene. The test is positive for 90% of people who are carriers. It is positive for 1% of people who are not carriers. If you test positive, what is the probability that you are actually a carrier?

---

## Application: Lupus

Lupus is a medical condition where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead see plasma proteins as foreign bodies, leading to a high risk of blood clotting. It is believed that 2% of the population suffer from this disease. The test is 98% accurate if a person actually has the disease. The test is 74% accurate if a person does not have the disease. There is a line from the Fox television show House that is often used after a patient tests positive for lupus: “It’s never lupus.” Do you think there is truth to this statement? Use appropriate probabilities to support your answer.

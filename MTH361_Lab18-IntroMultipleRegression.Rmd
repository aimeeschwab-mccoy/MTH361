## Question 1: Nursing salaries

Hospital administrators are often concerned about providing the best possible care to their patients while balancing the rising cost of healthcare. The data set `Nursing.csv` contains information from a random sample of 52 small hospitals in the state of New Mexico. Variables include:

- Number of beds
- Number of in-patient days per month
- Number of all-patient days per month
- Monthly revenue from patient care
- Monthly salaries for their nursing staff
- Expenditures on facility maintenance
- Whether or not the hospital is in a rural area

All expenditures and revenues are reported in thousands of dollars. Can we use these explanatory variables in a multiple regression model to predict the monthly revenue? (R output on the next page.)

```{r, echo=-1}
Nursing <- read.csv("C:/Users/ads67836/OneDrive - Creighton University/2018/Spring 2018 Courses/MTH 361 - Probability and Statistics in the Health Sciences/Slides/Nursing.csv")
#Nursing <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/Spring 2017 Courses/Math 516/Module 7 (Weeks 13-14)/Nursing.csv")
head(Nursing)
```

1. Which variable(s) in the model are "statistically significant"?

\vfill

2. Which variable(s) in the model are not statistically significant?

\vfill

\pagebreak

3. Interpret the slope for the number of beds.

\vfill

4. Predict the monthly revenue from patient care for hospital 2.

\vfill

5. How much of the variability in patient revenue can be explained using this linear model?

\vfill

```{r}
model <- lm(PatientRevenue ~ Beds + InPatientDays +  AllPatientDays + 
NurseSalaries + FacilitiesExpend, data=Nursing)
summary(model)
```

\pagebreak

__Question 2__: In multiple linear regression, we often decide to remove variables from the model that are non-significant. The new model, `model2`, only contains two explanatory variables: `Beds` and `AllPatientDays`.

1. Are these variables "statistically significant"? How do you know?

\vfill

2. Interpret the slope for the number of beds.

\vfill

3. Predict the monthly revenue from patient care for hospital 2.

\vfill

4. How much of the variability in patient revenue can be explained using this linear model?

\vfill

```{r}
model2 <- lm(PatientRevenue ~ Beds + AllPatientDays, data=Nursing)
summary(model2)
```

\pagebreak

5. Use the first two residual plots to evaluate this model. Are any of the necessary assumptions violated?

\vfill

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(model2)
```

\pagebreak

## Interpreting residual plots

It's difficult to really get a feel for what a "good" residual plot should look like without seeing a few "bad" ones. The plots below come from data sets where at least one of the LINE assumptions isn't met.

For each plot:

1. Which assumption(s) is/are problematic?
2. How does that manifest in the residual plots?

![Data set A](DataA.png)

![Data set B](DataB.png)

![Data set C](DataC.png)

![Data set D](DataD.png)

# Problem(s) to submit

On your own, complete the following problems. You may use your notes, this lab activity, or any other resources. Submit your answers in BlueLine when you are finished.
The FEV data set measures pulmonary function on children ages 3-19. This data set contains data on age, gender, height (inches), FEV (volume of air expelled in one second in liters), and smoking status.

```{r, echo=-1}
FEV <- read.csv("C:/Users/ads67836/OneDrive - Creighton University/MTH 361 - Biostatistics/Class Slides/FEV.csv")
#FEV <- read.csv("~/OneDrive - Creighton University/MTH 361 - Biostatistics/Worksheets and Labs/FEV.csv")
head(FEV)
```

a) Write the fitted multiple linear regression model for predicting FEV based on age, height, sex, and smoking status. (Output on the next page.)

\vfill

b) Which variables in this model are "significant"? Which variables aren't useful predictors?

\vfill

c) How much of the variability in FEV can be explained using this model?

\vfill

d) Based on the residual plots (next page), are the model assumptions met? Explain why or why not. 

\vfill

\pagebreak

```{r}
model <- lm(fev ~ age + height + sex + smoke, data=FEV)
summary(model)
```

```{r, echo=-1}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(model)
```
